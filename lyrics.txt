Wait right here
I'll be back in the mornin'
I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous (Yeah)
So much more than perfect (Yeah)
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I could work on it
Give me some time while I work on it
Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me (Yeah)
Look at my face when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
That's why your friends always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings
None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea
Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me
I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?
Look at my face while you talkin' to me
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
Can I get one conversation at least?
Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach
This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I'm fallin' to pieces

[Chorus]
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason

Fuck my life, can't save that, girl
Don't tell me you could save that shit
All she want is payback for the way I always play that shit
You ain't gettin' nothin' that I'm sayin'
Don't tell me you is
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
I can make you this, baby, I can make you that
I can take you there, but baby, you won't make it back
Growing sick of this and I don't wanna make you sad
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?

[Refrain]
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)

[Chorus]
Fuck my life, can't save that, girl
Don't tell me you could save that shit
All she want is payback for the way I always play that shit
You ain't gettin' nothin' that I'm sayin'
Don't tell me you is
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (Make you rich)
I can make you this, baby, I can make you that
I can take you there, but baby, you won't make it back
Growing sick of this and I don't wanna make you sad
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back? (Do I make you scared?)

[Bridge]
Down another lonely road, I go
Just another lonely road to home
I just wanna know, I just gotta know
Do you wanna glo? Baby, we could glo?

[Chorus]
Fuck my life, can't save that, girl
Don't tell me you could save that shit
All she want is payback for the way I always play that shit
You ain't gettin' nothin' that I'm sayin'
Don't tell me you is
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
I can make you this, baby, I can make you that
I can take you there, but baby, you won't make it back
Growing sick of this and I don't wanna make you sad
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?

[Outro]
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?
Nothin' like them other mothafuckas'
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)

She said I'm a crybaby, I can't be up lately
Girl, you drive me crazy, AMG Mercedes
Speedin' down the highway, lookin' at the street lights
Geekin' on a Friday, I can never sleep right
Knowin' I hurt you, I don't deserve you
I shoulda curved you, I know I'm the worst, boo
But I could be cool too, and you got them dance moves
And I got this vibe, I swear it's perfect to ride to
I wanna die too, we all wanna die too
I got this vibe, I swear she love gettin' high too
I love gettin' high too, I wanna hide you
How did I find you? I'll be inside, I'm makin' music to cry to

[Hook]
Oh, it's a lonely world, I know
Gon' get a lonely girl, that's fo' sho'
Oh, I'm a lonely boy, she made a lonely boy, yeah, I know
Oh, it's a lonely world, I know
Gon' get a lonely girl, that's fo' sho'
Oh, I'm a lonely boy, she made a lonely boy, yeah, I know

Lil Bo Peep with a brand new bitch
In the back of the club with the GothBoiClique
Iced out teeth on an iced out whip
With the limousine tints, you can suck my dick
Friends switch up when you in a Benz truck (Skrrt)
Always wanna fuck, tell a bitch, "Good luck"
Always wanna fuck 'cause I just came up, yeah
(GothBoiClique)

[Chorus]
Lil Bo Peep with a brand new bitch
In the back of the club with the GothBoiClique
Iced out teeth on an iced out whip
With the limousine tints, you can suck my dick
Friends switch up when you in a Benz truck (Skrrt)
Always wanna fuck, tell a bitch, "Good luck"
Always wanna fuck 'cause I just came up
Drugs in my nose, good drugs in my cup

[Verse]
I don't wanna wait now
But I know you gon' make me
Who you wanna hate now?
Pretty soon you gonna hate me (GothBoiClique)
Gettin' to the cake now
All the hate don't faze me
All the money that I make now
I'll never let it change me
I don't wanna wait now
But I know you gon' make me
Who you wanna hate now?
Pretty soon you gonna hate me
Gettin' to the cake now
All the hate don't faze me
All the money that I make now
I'll never let it change me
